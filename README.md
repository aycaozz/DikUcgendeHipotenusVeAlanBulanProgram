Perimeter of the triangle = 2𝑢
𝑢 = (a+b+c) / 2
Area * Area = 𝑢 * (𝑢 - 𝑎)* (𝑢 - 𝑏) * (𝑢 - 𝑐) 

Java program that takes the length of the perpendicular sides from the user, calculates the hypotenuse and finds the area of the triangle

TODO:
-variables are defined
-enter the sides of the triangle from the user
-find the hypotenuse of the triangle
-find the area of the triangle with the given formulas
